## Hi! I'm Valen (tin) 👋

- I'm from Argentina. 🇦🇷
- My favorite sport is listening to music. 🎵
- I'm a programmer with no experience at all.
- I'm working on several projects, although *that's affecting my psyche a bit...*
- I work on a PC from 2010, so let's say I can't do much more than web pages.

### Fun facts:
- If you type `:)` into Microsoft Word you will get a more complex smiley face.
- If you talk to me, I'll *probably answer you quickly* because, well, I have nothing to do, but you better not do it because *I'm better off sinking into my own loneliness*.

## Languages that I supposedly know:
- `HTML`
- `CSS`

### Languages I want to learn:
- `Python` (Omg! How could you not know Python? Idiot.)
- `JavaScript` (Omg! you really don't know anything about programming!)

## My projects:
- Half of my projects are or will be on this organization's page: [https://github.com/VRCco](https://github.com/VRCco)
- In short, I'm working on an open source platform to share links that the user wants. It's more complex to explain than my neurons can process right now. 🧠

### I am available for:
- Collaborating on open source projects, on the design side.
- Sharing ideas.
- Receiving help (Why why not).

### My learning:
- SEO *is brutally killing me*.

### A random memory:
- I thought I could make an AI, but clearly, my PC almost exploded. 💥

### Tools I use:
- Visual Studio Code 💻
- Git & GitHub 🛠️
- PicsArt (Yes, PicsArt, I can't use Adobe Photoshop.) 🎨

### Any future goals:
- Being able to give all my ideas to the world for free and help others like me.

### Some quotes I like (?)
> "The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do." - *Steve Jobs*
> "When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor." - *Elon Musk*
> "The biggest risk is not taking any risk." - *Mark Zuckerberg*

### Any achievements I would like to show off:
- I once made a comic about dolphins (supposedly, it was poorly done) mating and they gave me a 10.

*CLARIFICATION: Please do not use this description as something serious or a presentation, it would be very embarrassing and I did not do it for those purposes 😥*
