## Hi! I'm Valen (tin) ðŸ‘‹

- I'm from Argentina. ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·
- My favorite sport is listening to music.  ðŸŽµ
- I'm a programmer with no experience at all.
- I'm working on several projects, although *that's affecting my psyche a bit...*
- I work on a PC from 2010, so let's say I can't do much more than web pages.

Fun fact: if you type `:)` into Microsoft Word you will get a more complex smiley face.

Fun fact: If you talk to me I'll *probably answer you quickly* because well, I have nothing to do, but you better not do it because *I'm better off sinking into my own loneliness.*
