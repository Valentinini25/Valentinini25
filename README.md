## Hi! I'm Valen (tin) ðŸ‘‹

- I'm from Argentina. ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·
- My favorite sport is listening to music. ðŸŽµ
- I'm a programmer with no experience at all.
- I'm working on several projects, although *that's affecting my psyche a bit...*
- I work on a PC from 2010, so let's say I can't do much more than web pages.

### Fun facts:
- If you type `:)` into Microsoft Word you will get a more complex smiley face.
- If you talk to me, I'll *probably answer you quickly* because, well, I have nothing to do, but you better not do it because *I'm better off sinking into my own loneliness*.

### Languages that I supposedly know:
- `HTML`
- `CSS`

# Languages I want to learn
- `Python` (Omg! How could you not know Python? Idiot.)
- `JavaScript` (Omg! you really don't know anything about programming!)

### My projects 
- Half of my projects are or will be on this organization's page: hhtps://github.com/VRCco
- In short, I'm working on an open source platform to share links that the user wants, it's more complex to explain than my neurons can right now.
