## Hi! I'm Valen (tin) 👋

- I'm from Argentina. 🇦🇷
- My favorite sport is listening to music. 🎵
- I'm a programmer with no experience at all.
- I'm working on several projects, although *that's affecting my psyche a bit...*
- I work on a PC from 2010, so let's say I can only manage web pages for now.

### Fun facts:
- If you type `:)` into Microsoft Word, you'll get a more complex smiley face.
- If you talk to me, I'll *probably answer quickly* because, well, I have nothing to do, but you better not do it because *I'm better off sinking into my own loneliness*.

## Languages I supposedly know:
- `HTML`
- `CSS`

### Languages I want to learn:
- `Python` (Omg! How could you not know Python? Idiot.)
- `JavaScript` (Omg! you really don't know anything about programming!)

## My projects:
- Half of my projects are or will be hosted on this organization's page: [https://github.com/VRCco](https://github.com/VRCco)
- In short, I'm working on an open-source platform to share links that the user wants. It's too complex to explain with the mental capacity I currently have. 🧠

### I'm available for:
- Collaborating on open-source projects (design side).
- Sharing ideas.
- Receiving help (Why not?).

### My learning:
- SEO *is brutally killing me*.

### A random memory:
- I once tried to make an AI, but my PC nearly exploded. 💥

### Tools I use:
- Visual Studio Code 💻
- Git & GitHub 🛠️
- PicsArt (Yes, PicsArt, I can't use Adobe Photoshop) 🎨

### Future goals:
- To give all my ideas to the world for free and help others like me.

### Some quotes I like (?):  
> "The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do." – *Steve Jobs*  
> "When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor." – *Elon Musk*  
> "The biggest risk is not taking any risk." – *Mark Zuckerberg*  

### Achievements I like to show off:  
- I once made a comic about dolphins (supposedly, it was poorly done) mating... and I got a 10/10. 🎨

*CLARIFICATION: Please don’t take this description seriously, it was not meant for presentations and would be super embarrassing if used that way 😥*
