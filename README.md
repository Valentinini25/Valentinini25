## Hi! I'm Valen (tin) ðŸ‘‹

- I'm from Argentina. ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·
- My favorite sport is listening to music. ðŸŽµ
- I'm a programmer with no experience at all.
- I'm working on several projects, although *that's affecting my psyche a bit...*
- I work on a PC from 2010, so let's say I can't do much more than web pages.

### Fun facts:
- If you type `:)` into Microsoft Word you will get a more complex smiley face.
- If you talk to me, I'll *probably answer you quickly* because, well, I have nothing to do, but you better not do it because *I'm better off sinking into my own loneliness*.

## Languages that I supposedly know:
- `HTML`
- `CSS`

### Languages I want to learn:
- `Python` (Omg! How could you not know Python? Idiot.)
- `JavaScript` (Omg! you really don't know anything about programming!)

## My projects:
- Half of my projects are or will be on this organization's page: [https://github.com/VRCco](https://github.com/VRCco)
- In short, I'm working on an open source platform to share links that the user wants. It's more complex to explain than my neurons can process right now. ðŸ§

### My learning:
- SEO *is brutally killing me*

### a random memory:
- I thought I could make an AI, but clearly, my PC almost exploded.
